                    <p>
                        We met on either January 21st or 22nd, 2021, we're not sure, at our the first Family Home Evening activity of the winter semester. 
                        We we were acquaintences throughout the semester, but didn't start to become friends until spring break, 3 months later. Towards
                        the end of the semester we both caught Covid-19 and ended up staying in Rexburg for spring break, much to Anna's displeasure and
                        David's indifference. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A couple days into Spring Break (after our quarantine) we were both invited by friends to hike R Mountain. We didn't know it at
                        the time, but a year from then we would be getting married. On the way back, someone declared that they wanted nachos, and David,
                        not knowing how to make nachos, volunteered to make nachos. The rest of spring break, we spent together with our friends, eating
                        pizza and papusas, and putting make up on each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following sunday, Anna and another friend decided to make feijoada, the national dish of Brazil, for everyone. Our friend was
                        not able to help, so David helped Anna cook the food, and thats where our relationship really started. Later that day, we swapped
                        Instagrams, and started sending each other memes. Later that day, David asked Anna out for ice cream! Ice cream turned into dinner
                        at Millhollow, and dinner turned into doing homework together. Since then, we've spent pretty much every day together. Even while
                        living across the country from each other, we've managed to call, text, play games and video chat with each other every day. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've come a long way from where we were a year ago, and we're really excited to get married and start our lives together! Thank 
                        you for sharing this day with us!
                    </p>
